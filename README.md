## Getting Started

You need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. In this project, I will use NPM for installing packages and running scripts.

```
npm install
npm run webdrvr-upd   
```

## Running UI Test

```
npm run e2e
```

## REPORTING

Go to tmp\screenshots and open report.html file
```
